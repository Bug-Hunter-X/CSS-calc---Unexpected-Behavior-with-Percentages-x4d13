The solution involves ensuring proper unit handling and order of operations within the `calc()` function.  Avoid mixing percentages directly with fixed units within the same `calc()` expression. Consider using intermediate variables or breaking down complex calculations into simpler ones.  For example, instead of `width: calc(50% - 10px);` consider using variables to make calculations more readable and less prone to unexpected behavior:

```css
:root {
  --half-width: 50%;
  --margin: 10px;
}

.element {
  width: calc(var(--half-width) - var(--margin));
}
```

This makes the calculation more readable and less prone to unexpected results.  In more complex scenarios, it may be necessary to pre-calculate values using JavaScript and then apply the final result to the CSS.
